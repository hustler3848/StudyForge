# StudyForge

## Project Description

StudyForge is a next-generation, AI-powered learning platform designed to help students unlock their full academic potential. It addresses the universal challenges of time management, motivation, and effective study habits by replacing manual planning and guesswork with intelligent, automated tools. The result is a personalized learning ecosystem that adapts to each student's unique needs, saving them time and reducing academic stress.

At its core, StudyForge is powered by a suite of sophisticated AI tools built with **Groq** for real-time generation. Key features include:

*   **Smart Study Plan Generator:** This flagship tool transforms a student's subjects, upcoming exams, assignments, and available free time into a structured, prioritized weekly and daily study schedule. It eliminates the overwhelming task of planning, allowing students to focus purely on learning.

*   **Flashcard Generator:** The platform can instantly convert text notes, PDFs, or even photos of handwritten notes into digital flashcard decks. This automates a tedious but vital study method, making review sessions more efficient.

*   **Essay Reviewer:** Students receive instant, AI-driven feedback on their essays, including scores for grammar and readability, plus actionable suggestions for improving clarity, structure, and tone. It even provides a corrected rewrite, acting as a 24/7 writing tutor.

*   **AI Quick Quiz & Readiness Calculator:** Users can generate custom quizzes on any topic to test their knowledge or use the AI Readiness tool to get a data-driven score on their exam preparedness, complete with a personalized coaching tip.

To foster motivation and consistency, StudyForge incorporates gamified elements like a **Study Streak tracker** and a minimalist **Focus Session** timer with a live progress ring. Furthermore, the **Community Rooms** feature creates a collaborative environment where students can join subject-specific groups, share their study streaks on a leaderboard, and participate in daily AI-generated challenges.

Built on a modern tech stack including **Next.js, Firebase, and Tailwind CSS**, StudyForge provides a seamless, responsive, and secure user experience. By integrating these powerful AI features into a single, intuitive platform, StudyForge empowers students to study smarter, not just harder.
